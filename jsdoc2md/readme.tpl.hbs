#trello-snapshots

A snapshotting library for polling Trello and persisting serialised versions of boards to disk.

Can be used as a backup method for saving snapshots of boards *(note - only a large subset of board data is stored)* or
retrieving data from boards at regular intervals.

##Usage
To use *trello-snapshots* add the npm package to your project.
```sh
npm i trello-snapshots
```
You will need to get a Trello API key and token. To allow *trello-snapshots* to pull data you will need a read token. To get your key and token follow the steps: 
 1. Sign in to Trello and navigate to [https://trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key).
 2. Navigate to https://trello.com/1/connect?key=...&name=MyApp&response_type=token&scope=read, substituting your key in.

##Basic Usage
```javascript
const Snapshotter = require('trello-snapshots')

let mySnapshotter = new Snapshotter(key, token, 'my board', './snapshots');
mySnapshotter.start();
```
